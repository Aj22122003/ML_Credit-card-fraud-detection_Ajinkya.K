**🚀 Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:** 💻
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AJ22122003/ML_Credit-card-fraud-detection_Ajinkya.K.git](https://github.com/AJ22122003/ML_Credit-card-fraud-detection_Ajinkya.K.git)
    cd ML_Credit-card-fraud-detection_Ajinkya.K
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:** 👇
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** 🚀
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook CreditCard.ipynb
    ```

4.  **Run the cells in the notebook:** The notebook contains the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. Follow the instructions within the notebook to understand the process and results. 🧠

5.  **Explore the dataset:** The `Data.csv` file contains labeled examples of credit card transactions, indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or genuine. Understanding the structure of this dataset is crucial for interpreting the model's results accurately. 🔍

**📊 Model Evaluation**

The machine learning model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results and insights into the model's performance are presented in the Jupyter Notebook. You might also find visual reports related to specific classifiers (Extra Trees and Random Forest) as indicated by the `extratreeClreport.png` and `randomforestClreport.png` files. 📈
